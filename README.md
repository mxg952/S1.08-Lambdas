# S1.05 - Lambdas

## ðŸŸ¢ Level 1
In the path "/level1/AllExcercices/model/LambdaMethods.java" there are the methods for any of the follow exercises:

### Exercise 1
Create a method that returns a list of strings containing the letter 'o'. Use lambdas and the Streams API.

### Exercise 2
Extend the previous method to also filter for strings longer than 5 characters.

### Exercise 3
Create a list with the names of the months. Print each element using a lambda expression.

### Exercise 4
Print the list of months using a **method reference** instead of a lambda.

### Exercise 5
Create a functional interface with a method `getPiValue()` that returns 3.1415 using a lambda.

### Exercise 6
Create a list containing strings and numbers, and sort it by string length from shortest to longest.

### Exercise 7
Sort the same list in reverse order, from longest to shortest string.

### Exercise 8
Create a functional interface with a method `reverse()` that takes a string and returns it reversed via a lambda.

## ðŸŸ¡ Level 2
In the path "/level2/AllExcercices/model/LambdaMethodsLevel2.java" there are the methods for any of the follow exercises:

### Exercise 1
Create a list of names. Write a method that returns the names starting with 'A' and having exactly 3 letters.

### Exercise 2
Write a method that returns a comma-separated string from a list of integers, prefixing each with 'e' for even and 'o' for odd.

### Exercise 3
Create a functional interface with a method `operation()` that returns a float. Inject different operations (sum, subtract, multiply, divide) using lambdas.

### Exercise 4
Create a mixed list with text and numbers. Apply:
- Alphabetical sorting by first character.
- Sorting with strings containing 'e' first.
- Replace all 'a' characters with '4'.
- Filter and show only numeric strings.
